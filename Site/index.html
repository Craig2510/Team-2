                <p>Glasgow Green is by far the oldest of the city's parks. It is situated within walking distance of the
                    city centre east of the Saltmarket. It is currently undergoing a renaissance with major investment
                    through the Lottery Heritage Fund providing a catalyst for the redevelopment of the local
                    neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>Famously, in 1765, the Green was the site of a historic inspiration: The inventor James Watt was
                    strolling across it when he hit upon the idea of the separate condenser for the steam engine. This
                    invention is credited by some as having sparked the Industrial Revolution.</p>

                <p>Originally acquired by the Burgh of Partick, Victoria Park was named for Queen Victoria’s golden
                    jubilee in 1887. The park is extremely popular with the public being one of the most visited parks
                    in Glasgow. It contains extensive formal and informal gardens, an arboretum, a boating pond, bowling
                    greens and tennis courts.</p>
                <p>The park also contains the Fossil Grove museum which houses pre-historic fossils known as lycopods or
                    giant clubmosses. There is also a recreation ground, a children’s play area with equipment suitable
                    for children with disabilities, and the park features a hidden maze, cycle route and orienteering
                    course. Victoria Park is listed on Historic Scotland’s Gardens and Designed Landscapes Inventory.
